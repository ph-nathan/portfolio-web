# Nhat's Portfolio

My portfolio website developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) at [https://nhat-pham.vercel.app/] (https://nhat-pham.vercel.app/)


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the website.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This project used [framer-motion](framer.com/motion), an open source motion library for React. This library facilitates smooth and simple animations. The only downside to this library is that the use of motion components converts a lot of components to client side, but considering the scale of the project, this won't be too detrimental performance-wise.

In the contact section, [resend](https://resend.com/overview) was used to facilitate the email sending process from web-visitors to web-owner.
